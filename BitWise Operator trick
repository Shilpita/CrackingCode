Operator    Name         Example     Result  Description
a & b       and          3 & 5       1       1 if both bits are 1.
a | b       or           3 | 5       7       1 if either bit is 1.
a ^ b       xor          3 ^ 5       6       1 if both bits are different.
~a          not          ~3          -4      Inverts the bits.
n << p      left shift   3 << 2      12      Shifts the bits of n left p positions. Zero bits are shifted into the low-order positions.
n >> p      right shift  5 >> 2      1       Shifts the bits of n right p positions. If n is a 2's complement signed number, the sign bit is shifted into the high-order positions.
n >>> p     right shift  -4 >>> 28   15      Shifts the bits of n right p positions. Zeros are shifted into the high-order positions.


These operators can come in handy when you need to read and write to integers where the individual bits should be interpreted as flags, or when a specific range of bits in an integer have a special meaning and you want to extract only those. You can do a lot of every day programming without ever needing to use these operators, but if you ever have to work with data at the bit level, a good knowledge of these operators is invaluable.


(decimal)    (binary)
     5     =  101
     6     =  110
------------------ xor
     3     =  011


^ | 0 1      ^ | F T
--+-----     --+-----
0 | 0 1      F | F T
1 | 1 0      T | T F



Lot many people have already explained about what it is and how it can be used but apart from the obvious you can use this operator to do a lot of programming tricks like

XORing of all the elements in a boolean array would tell you if the array has odd number of true elements
If you have an array with all numbers repeating even number of times except one which repeats odd number of times you can find that by XORing all elements.
Swapping values without using temporary variable
Finding missing number in the range 1 to n
Basic validation of data sent over the network.
Lot many such tricks can be done using bit wise operators, interesting topic to explore.
